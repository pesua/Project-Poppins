This app generates questions for the most important points of given text. Selective summarization with LexRank is used to find most relevant sentences in the text to transform them into questions and answers.
The project may be used in automatic educational systems.

To run the code you have to download stanford-corenlp-2012-04-09-models.jar from http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml (Version 1.3.1) and put it into lib/ directory.
